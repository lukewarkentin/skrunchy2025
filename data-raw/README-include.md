### `freshwater-catch.xlsx` 

This file has the terminal freshwater mortality numbers by return year. Columns with headers highlighted in green are used in subsequent analysis and are shown in Winther et al. 2024 Appendix 2 Table 1. LW checked file against table 2025-05-13.

Notes: 
- Jack estimates at Tyee and in FN and Rec fisheries (based on length) include a large portion of age 4 fish. This file combines jack and large estimates, before age 3 fish are removed using age proportions (to account for age 4 fish in the original jack estimates based solely on length).
- Recreational catch is estimated differently across the time series. See notes in file and Winther et al. 2024 Appendix 2, page 120 for details https://waves-vagues.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/library-bibliotheque/41241046.pdf
